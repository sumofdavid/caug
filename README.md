# Create a User Group (CAUG)
  
##Background
Many technical user group websites are pathetic in many ways.  They are usually created by someone who lacks visual design skills and is time constrained.  The creators are rarely paid to create the initial site and therefore little time is put into it as to how it will be maintained in the future.  Some sites are created using popular, at the time, CMS frameworks (DNN, WP, Joomla, etc), but become quickly outdated in look, feel, and functionality if they are not actively maintained.  Other sites lack current content because of the difficulty in maintaining them by someone other than the coder who created the site.  
  
I believe that it's possible to create a service where a user group President or Director can come and choose from a minimum selection of themes/templates and within seconds have a user group website which they can then add content to.  
  
User group sites are fairly consistent in their needs and are primarily content and link driven with social hooks.  This opportunity allows for a narrowly focused service.  
  
##Overview
The intention of the CAUG service is to create a website where people who need a website for their user group can come and create one simply by picking from a set of features and choose the look & feel from a sample of themes.  
  
I will use the Github wiki pages to document everything that went into this service from the beginning.
